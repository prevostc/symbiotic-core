/**
 * @title IIsolatedOperatorDelegator
 * @notice Interface for an isolated operator delegator that manages stake allocation per operator.
 *
 * @dev Stake Allocation and Proportional Reduction:
 * This delegator allows setting stake amounts for individual operators. When the total allocated
 * stake exceeds the available vault collateral, all operators' stakes are proportionally reduced
 * to ensure the sum doesn't exceed the available collateral.
 *
 * Example:
 * - Operator A allocated: 10 tokens
 * - Operator B allocated: 10 tokens
 * - Operator C allocated: 30 tokens
 * - Total allocated: 50 tokens, Vault collateral: 50 tokens â†’ All operators get their full allocation
 *
 * After a withdrawal leaving only 10 tokens in the vault:
 * - Operator A effective stake: 10 * (10/50) = 2 tokens
 * - Operator B effective stake: 10 * (10/50) = 2 tokens
 * - Operator C effective stake: 30 * (10/50) = 6 tokens
 * - Total effective stake: 10 tokens (matches available collateral)
 *
 * All view functions return effective stakes (after proportional reduction if needed).
